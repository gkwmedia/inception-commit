# Inception Commit History

Inception Commit History is a project that shows and inception of commits. I choose this name from as I thought the idea reminded me of the movie Inception. The project showcases all of the commits that I used to make the site in itself giving you an idea of the steps taken to create it.

## Basic Ddependencies

- Code Editor or terminal access
- Node JS - if you do not have Node JS installed you can download it from: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Angular CLI - to install this you must have Node isntalled. Simply run the command "npm install -g @angular/cli" in your terminal to install the Angular CLI

## Running Inception Development Server

- Start by either cloning the github respository (using this command "gh repo clone gkwmedia/inception-commit") or downloading the code directly from github
- Open the project folder in your code editor or navigate to the directory within your terminal
- If you opened the project in your code editor open a terminal within your editor (ensuring the directy of the terminal is the same as the project) and type the command "npm install". This will install of the dependencies for the projct. If you did not open the project in a code editor but are in the terminal you will need to type "npm install" in your teriminal.
- From here you can start the developent server of the project by typing ng serve and navigating to Localhost:4200 in your browser.
